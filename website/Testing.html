<h3> Skills I would like to polish/learn </h3>
<dl> 
    <dt> HTML </dt>
        <dd> 
            I would like to polish my html as <br>
            website creation is in demand and <br>
            is pretty cool.
        </dd>
    <dt> C++ </dt>
        <dd>
            This is my main language and polishing <br>
            this language can help me understand <br>
            difficult concepts.
        </dd>
    <dt> Python </dt>
        <dd>
            Python is quickly growing and simple <br>
            to learn. Ideally, I would like it to <br>
            be as good as my C++.
